# pyGSTR
This repository contains Python demo scripts for stuff I want to use in a professional context, but modularized so I can easily verify the correct working of it.
It's easy to forget specific functionality of those 1000's of existing modules, so this also serves as an easy example database, conveniently adapted to my needs.
